*zoxide-vim.txt*	A small (Neo)Vim wrapper for zoxide

USAGE					*zoxide-vim* *:Z*

:Z {query}		cd to the highest ranked directory matching your
			query. If {query} is omitted, cd to the home
			directory.

:Lz {query}		same as :Z but local to the current
			window.

:Tz {query}		same as :Z but local to the current tab.

:Zi {query}		cd to one of your highest ranking directories using
			fzf.

:Lzi {query}		same as :Zi, but local to the current
			window.

:Tzi {query}		same as :Zi, but local to the current
			tab.

CONFIGURATION				*zoxide-vim-configuration*

					*g:zoxide_executable*
g:zoxide_executable
			The name of path of the zoxide executable.

			Default value: `'zoxide'`

					*g:zoxide_prefix*
g:zoxide_prefix
			The prefix to use for commands. Example: >

			let g:zoxide_prefix = 'jump'
<
			Generates the following commands:

			:Jump
			:Ljump
			:Tjump
			:Jumpi
			:Ljumpi
			:Tjumpi

			Default value: `'z'`

					*g:zoxide_update_score*
g:zoxide_update_score
			Decides whether the zoxide database should be updated
			when you cd into a directory.

			Default value: `1`

					*g:zoxide_legacy_aliases*
g:zoxide_legacy_aliases
			Defines aliases :Za and :Zr. These were removed from
			the main zoxide package because they were used too
			infrequently:
			https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/pull/158
			(They probably don't warrant adding any kind of alias
			in Vim either because it's really easy to use
			":!zoxide add {query}").

			I'm going to remove them in the future.

			Default value: `0`
